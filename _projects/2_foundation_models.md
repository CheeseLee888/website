Prior knowledge is a powerful form of context in statistical inference. Traditionally, applying such knowledge required expert intervention on each new problem. Today, foundation models encode broad domain knowledge in a reusable, black-box format. Our work focuses on extracting and operationalizing this implicit knowledge by connecting foundation models to structured, parametric statistical models.

<p>
We are building a bi-directional bridge between foundation models and structured statistical estimation:
